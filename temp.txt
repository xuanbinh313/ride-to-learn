question 89 to 91 Refer to the following instructions
Good morning, everyone.
The reason why I called the meeting this early in the morning is to update you on our new security procedures,
which will be implemented next week.
Starting next Monday, all employees are asked to wear ID badges in our building at all times.
Also, you need to place the badge in the security panel to enter the building.
If you havenâ€™t gotten your picture taken, please do so in the staff lounge on the third floor after the meeting.
Please make sure that the new ID badges will be issued and delivered to each department head on Friday.
Finally, all visitors should sign in at the main gate for a temporary badge before entering the building.
Thank you for your cooperation.
