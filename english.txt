Hello, this message is for Ron Myers. 
This is Lora Thompson from Perfect Dream Insurance. 
I’m calling concerning a small mistake on the invoice I received this morning from your store.
I ordered a computer desk and 5 large filing cabinets, 
but it looks like we are being charged twice as much for the desk. 
When I placed the phone order last week, you told me the desk would cost $80. 
But you charged us $160 for it.
Fortunately, it appears that the money hasn’t been debited from our company account yet. 
Could you send us a revised statement by email later today so that I can settle the payment as soon as possible? Thank you.
